#genuary 019 • Use text/typography.

I used this prompt as an opportunity to try out the rad live-coding playground that @andreasgysin built.

My starting point was one of the examples so I don't get much (any?) credit for creativity here -- I just needed an excuse to test out the playground!!!! Forgive me. Then go try it for yourself!
