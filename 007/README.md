-----

Draw a line segment from top to bottom at a random horizontal position.

Select a point at random.

Choose, in an alternating fashion, to draw a horizontal or vertical segment.

Based on the orientation, find the two nearest segments (including the edges) and join them with a new line segment.

Repeat.
