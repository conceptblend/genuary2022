## Output

This one did not go as expected -- and I'm happy about that!

I started with the idea of a demoscene starfield kind of animation and made an error early on that I really liked the initial effect of. So I rolled with it and shaped out this effect as something i quite enjoy and that I think reflects the prompt of "space".
